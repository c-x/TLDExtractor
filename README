* MAIN *

This C lib was created to identify TLDs, including more than one level ones, in a fast way.

The library is supposed to be compiled with an embeded list of known TLDs. To make this list, you can :
A/ Use the provided one (tldlist.c), 
or
B/ Update/create yours (with the python code provided).

The list is a compilation of IANA and MOZILLA PUBLIC SUFFIX lists.

* INSTALLATION *

Updating the list

	If you want to update the list, go to the generator directory an run the python script. 
	This will produce a 'tldlist.c' file. Move, or copy, that file into the source folder.

	# cd generator
	# python generate-headers.py
	# mv tldlist.c ../src/
	
Compiling the lib

	Well, the library is a proof of concept that can be easly integrated into your developments.
	However, a sample program (main.c) is provided for education (-:

	Just compile it with the "make" command.
